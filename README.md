## Stay Safe,Stay Protected.


We are WTS, A Cybersecurity Team whose entire purpose is to warn and protect people who got their sensitive and private data leaked.


We work with a application which we designed to search for recently leaked emails and password on various hacking/cracking forum,pastebins,websites etc.
For the moment being, we are only able to send a warning message to the email which might land up in spam folder and would be ignored 9/10 times but if their
is 1 guy in 10 who can get alerted and protect his account then we are more than happy to help.




more coming soon
